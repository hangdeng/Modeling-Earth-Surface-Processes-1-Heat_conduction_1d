the usgs permafrost t profile data is available on this site:

https://www.aoncadis.org/dataset/USGS_DOI_GTN-P/file.html
those i plotted up, and that gary clow suggests we use, are the awuna files. they start with AWU in the list of files.

the site gives more background and other links to the usgs deep borehole array
